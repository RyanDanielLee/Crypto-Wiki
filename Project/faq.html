		<table>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="table_dt">How many currencies are there?</span></th>
				<th>There are thousands upon thousands of coins, and anyone can create one with coding knowledge</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="table_dt">Who creates these currencies?</span></th>
				<th>Usually companies interested in creating a decentralized platform, but others may vary as anyone can create one. For example, Dogecoin was created as a joke and the creators never planned on it going anywhere. Today it is in the top 10 biggest market caps.</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="table_dt">Where exactly is my crypto stored?</span></th>
				<th>Crypto currencies aren't really stored "anywhere," but stored "everywhere" if that makes sense. It is stored on the blockchain while everything on the network is being validated. Your ledger does not "store" your crypto, but allows you to make choices with it.</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><span class="table_dt">What about taxes?</span></th>
				<th>Although I am not an accountant, or financial advisor, I believe the taxes on crypto in Canada work much like stocks. You do not have to pay taxes on crypto when you are either buying it with fiat, or transfering it to an external wallet. You do need to pay taxes when you are selling crypto as a capital gain, or trading your crypto for another. However, the best advice you can receive on crypto is through your accountant or financial advisor.</th>
