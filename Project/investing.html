			<h2>Security</h2>
			<p>So you're interested in investing in crypto currency, but don't know how to start? The first and most crucial thing you need to do is aquire a blockchain wallet. There are many choices of wallets such as online providers such as <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus</a>, built-in wallets such as <a href="https://www.metamask.io/">Metamask</a> which is built into your chrome browser, or cold storage wallets such as <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/">Ledger Nano S</a>. Which type of wallet should you choose? An online wallet is convenient, but the least safe, as technically you are not in possession of your own crypto. Secondly, the built in browser wallets are the best middle ground wallets, and are pretty safe if you are smart about your privacy. Lastly, the cold storage wallet is the most protected form of a wallet, as it is always offline, but it does come at a price (usually in the $100-$200 range). Once you've aquired a wallet and set it up, the wallet will provide you with something called a "private key." It is incredibly important you write this down somewhere safe, and absolutely do not share this with anyone. This will help you back up your wallet in case you lose it. </p>

			<h2>Exchanges</h2>
			<p>Once you've aquired a wallet, how do you buy your crypto? Much like stock exchanges, there are also crypto exchanges. In Canada, the biggest two exchanges are <a href="https://shakepay.com/">Shakepay</a> and <a href="https://www.newton.co/">Newton</a>, however, just because we are in Canada, does not mean we are limited to just Canadian exchanges. You can essentially use any exchanges that accept transactions in Canada. The most popular exchanges around the world are <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>. You can either transfer your already existing crypto to these exchanges and trade for other currencies, or you can pay with fiat (or Canadian dollar in this case). You can also sell your crypto on exchanges for fiat and transfer it directly into your bank account. Before sinking your money into any of these exchanges, make sure they are not scams and are 99% safe. The exchanges that I previously mentioned are all safe, however, exchanges can go down or be hacked at any time, so they are not entirely 100% safe. Make sure after you have purchased your crypto that you trasnfer it to your blockchain wallet, and never leave your holdings on exchanges, unless you are planning on buying/selling/trading it within the near future. </p>

			<h2>How to Invest ?</h2>
			<p>Again, I cannot tell you how to spend your money, and do not take any financial advice from me, this is all my opinion. In my opinion, the best way to invest into crypto is to dollar-cost-average. This is where you set a schedule to buy crypto at certain times, such as once a week, regardless of the price. This is extremely effective because every four years, the amount of bitcoin that can be mined is halved which drives the prices up. I am not going to go into more detail, but every four years, bitcoin enters a bull market and skyrockets to new all time highs. Unlike stocks, crypto can hover from thousands upon thousands of percentage gain within a day, or it can also do the opposite. If you cannot handle this, you can either buy crypto and leave it in your wallet for years without looking at it, or don't invest in it at all. Another way of investing is studying the market and trading between currencies. This should not be preformed by beginners, and I would not advise it for anyone at all because it has proven to cause severe anxiety. You also have to pay taxes on trades, but do not have to when purchasing with fiat, unless you sell it at a profit. </p>
