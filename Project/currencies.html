			<h2>Types of Currencies</h2>
			<p>There are many different kinds of crypto currencies with all them serving different purposes that are more than just another type of currency you can trade things with. Here are the 10 biggest market-cap crypto currencies (as of July 2021):</p>
			<ul type="1">
				<li>Bitcoin (used as a store of value like gold and silver)</li>
				<li>Ethereum (used as  a way to allow developers to build and public smart contracts, and distribute decentralized applications)</li>
				<li>Tether (a stablecoin which is backed by the US Dollar. The coin will always be worth 1USD)</li>
				<li>Binance Coin (similar to ethereum, but runs on the binance smart chain network. Also backed by the exchange "Binance")</li>
				<li>Cardano (same as ethereum, a competitor)</li>
				<li>Dogecoin (a "meme" coin that was created as a joke, but holds value to this day)</li>
				<li>XRP (similar to bitcoin, but instead on the Ripple Network)</li>
				<li>USDC (another stablecoin backed by the US Dollar)</li>
				<li>Polkadot (a project that builds a "bridge" between different networks)</li>
				<li>Uniswap (an anonymous peer-to-peer exchange that is run on the ethereum network</li>
			</ul>
				
		
		<!-- How They Differ Column -->
			<h2>How They Differ</h2>
			<p>Now that you have grasped a small percentage of what crypto currencies have to offer, you may ask how do they differ? Well, there are many different purposes and use cases for each currency. In Bitcoin's case, it is used as a store of value, like how gold and silver are in the physical world. Projects like Ethereum and Cardano are networks that are used to create and share decentralized apps that revolve around business & financial services, and as well as entertainment applications such as video streaming sites or games. Think of it like their own internet, but decentralized. This is why I think the Internet will change forever and be rebuilt again when decentralization goes mainstream. Projects such as Chainlink, THETA, or Aave specialize in their own applications, while running on somebody's network like Ethereum. Coins like Dogecoin and SHIBA INU are labelled as "meme" coins and are very risky to invest money into, especially when they have no real world purpose. Think of the "meme" coins like GME or AMC stock that has been all over the news. There are still hundreds of coins I did not cover, but those were the general basics. You can find more projects on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Coin Market Cap</a></p>
		
		<!-- Networks Column -->
			<h2>Networks</h2>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, currencies such as Ethereum and Cardano operate as a network that provide decentralized apps. When transfering tokens between exchanges and your wallet, you must be very careful that you select the correct network you are transfering your crypto to. Before trasnfering your crypto, I would advise that you research what network your crypto currency runs on. The most common protocol is the ERC-20 protocol which is what Ethereum runs on. However, there are more protocols such as BEP-20 and BEP-2 that run on Binance's network.</p>
