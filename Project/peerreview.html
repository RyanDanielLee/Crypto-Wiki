				<th>Paloma Passos Vieeira Dos Santos</th>
				<th><a href="https://mylinux.langara.ca/~ppassosvieirad00/project/index.html">TechStore Link</a></th>
				<th>Theme, the colours and background colours involved, the use of many images and the visual aspects in general, and is very clear on what the purpose of the website is.</th>
				<th>Perhaps you could add a description to the products as that would make the store much more appealing as you would know exactly what you're purchasing. Also providing info on the "About Us" page would be helpful for the customers.</th>

				<th>Kailash Traders</th>
				<th>Shivangi Patel</th>
				<th><a href="https://mylinux.langara.ca/~spatel27/project/index.html">Kailash Traders Link</a></th>
				<th>Has real world value because it is based off of her familys' business, website purpose is clear, narration audio that guides you through the website, information and informational videos, and the live slideshow of images that are presented.</th>
				<th>I think the website would be even better if the text was added into the image (through GIMP or Photoshop, etc), which would make the text fit the porportions of the image when resizing.</th>

				<th>Sherry Vape Zone</th>
				<th>Sagar Patel</th>
				<th><a href="https://mylinux.langara.ca/~spatel22/project/index.html">Sherry Vape Zone Link</a></th>
				<th>The concept of the website is interesting, information is informative on vapes, is very clear on what the website is about.</th>
				<th>Changing the colour of the text to a different colour, as it is sort of hard to read. Also, maybe add a background colour and center the web page as there is a lot of blank space.</th>
