			<h2>How it Works</h2>
			<p>Like mining real gold, Bitcoin and crypto currencies work in a similar manner. The unknown creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, created Bitcoin with a limit of how many can be mined, with the limit being 21 million, similar to how there is a finite source of gold on Earth. Every four years the amount of bitcoin rewarded for mining cuts in half, which prevents inflation, unlike the US Dollar where trillions of dollars are printed every year. Now how exactly does Bitcoin mining work? The term mining does not actually mean you have to physically "mine," but rather you use your computer as a processor for transactions and validator. The blockchain contains complex math questions, and whichever computers solve it first will validate the transaction, and be rewarded with bitcoin. The questions increase in difficulty when there are more powerful computers to make it even.  </p>
		
		<!-- Requirements column -->
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>Mining has become more and more competitve as computers have become more and more powerful. To mine bitcoin, you will most likely need the components of a modern day gaming computer or better. This can become quite costly as the average price of a modern gaming computer is around $800 to $1200, which won't even get you the highest end specs. However, if you continue on mining, you can most likely earn all that money back, and more; this doesn't even factor in that the price of bitcoin will go up. Here are some basics you need to mine bitcoin:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Powerful Computer (with specs like a modern day gaming computer, or better)</li>
				<li>A good source of electricity, as it will use much more electricity than usual</li>
				<li>A mining software, such as <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/">NiceHash</a>
				<li>A Crypto Wallet</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How to Start "Mining"</h2>
			<p>Now once you have all the requirements, you should open up your program, such as NiceHash. Place in your address, and select your GPU (not the CPU). At the bottom of the program it will tell you how much you will earn in a day. All you have to do is leave your computer on with the program running. Again, this can be quite costly and you should monitor your electricity usage, as using more electricity will raise your electricity bills, and you could potentially lose on money when you are mining bitcoin.</p>
